Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. You can put a picture in, too. Just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `assets/img/` folder.

My recent projects include the [Nipah Polymerase Inhibitor Discovery](https://github.com/vihaan101/Nipah-Polymerase-Inhibitor) pipeline, where I explored computational drug discovery methods for the Nipah virus.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
